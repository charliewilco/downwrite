## Features

### All Markdown

Downwrite lets you import markdown files, edit with markdown shortcuts and export markdown file with YAML frontmatter that you can use in your Jekyll / Gatsby / WordPress /whatever site. Markdown is a really ubiquitous format.

### Share Your Work

When you write and want to share your work, select the privacy setting to make your entry public and get a URL to share. All posts are private by default.

### Offline Support

Sometimes when you're working you lose connectivity, Downwrite will save a local draft of your work and let you work without a connection and suggest a draft to save when you're back online.
