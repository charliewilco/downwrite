So the idea here was simple build a simple markdown writing application. Markdown is a huge deal and all the cool tools kept getting shut down and naively, I thought, how hard can this really be? So I've had poorly designed iterations of this thing for every year on the year as one of these services got shut down. When Canvas shut down this last year, I started to get a little more serious about this idea.

During planning out some of my quarterly goals at my last job I decided to go a little more full-stack with Node and start to really work through the process of building a microservice. Since I'm never really one to learning languages and frameworks in the abstract, I decided to take up Downwrite as an excuse to build those microservice.
