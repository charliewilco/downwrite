## Privacy Policy

> **TLDR**: Any content, albeit your personal information or an entry, is private until you
opt out of making the entry private. I do not have the intention of selling,
repackaging for sale, any of your content. And obviously this site uses cookies and
disabling them is a bad idea.

Your privacy is important to us.
