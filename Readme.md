## About 🤔🦄🎉

> _A place to write._ ✍️

So the idea here was simple build a simple markdown writing application. Markdown is a huge deal and all the cool tools kept getting shut down and naively,I thought, _how hard can this really be_? 🤔📝📦

So I've had poorly designed iterations of this thing for every year, on the year as one of these services got shut down. When [Canvas](https://blog.usecanvas.com/) shut down this last year, I started to get a little more serious about this idea. 💡 ⚡🔭

During planning out some of my quarterly goals at my last job I decided to go a little more full-stack with Node and start to really work through the process of building a microservice. Since I'm never really one to learning languages and frameworks in the abstract, I decided to take up Downwrite as an excuse to build those microservices. 📡💸🌎

### Why Markdown 🧐🤨📋

Markdown is probably the most efficient and universal tool for conveying syntax, semantics and structure across platforms. ⬇️

Originally coined by [John Gruber (Daring Fireball)](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) it was originally conceived as a text to HTML and is the staple of static site generators, OSS as well as a fair amount of comment sections, notetaking applications or any documentation tool. 🛠

These shortcuts are almost as ubiquitous as `cmd + b` for bold or `cmd + i` for italics. ⌨️

> Bottomline: markdown is data. It is a method for describing semantics of data and is data itself.

## Features ✨🔥🚀

This is meant to be a simple writing application with some key features:

- Write wherever you are (even offline) in markdown
- Share what you've written if you want
- Upload a markdown file from your machine
- Export to a static markdown file for your blog, etc.

## Setup 📲⏳⚙️

This project uses [Yarn Workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/blog/2017/08/02/introducing-workspaces/) and is written mostly with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

```bash
brew cask install yarn
yarn
```

### Client ⚡️🦊

![Logos for Related Projects](.github/Client.png)

#### Working on this Project

Run in your terminal from the root of the project.

```bash
yarn workspace client dev
```

Open [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

#### Info 📝

This is the client-side of the application. It uses Next.js and Express and uses [this example](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/examples/custom-server-express) to handle routing to different views. 👨‍💻🤜🦑🤯

Downwrite needs to server side rendered to make sharing an entry as easy as possible. Next.js' data-fetching API makes it the perfect candidate. The Express server also proxies the API server `localhost:4000` under the hood. So when the page calls `Component.getInitialProps()` it fetches the data from the API server and for the initial render it has data available instead of a skeleton screen. ☠︎🕱

For the Editor this project uses Draft.js and Draft.js Plugins. Markdown syntax is used inline and autogenerates the related rich text `_hello_` becomes "_hello_" as you type.

For styles I've used ~~Aphrodite~~, ~~JSXStyle~~, ~~glamor~~, and styled-components 💅. Most components are just `styled.div`\`\`; [managing class names hasn't really ever been my thing](https://charlespeters.net/writing/i-just-cant-with-css/). The styling also includes a Night theme that's managed through styled component's `<ThemeProvider>` and `localStorage`. 🌘🌛🌌 So it only ever renders on the client.

This project is a PWA, it uses some basic service worker implementation and `manifest.json` managed by `next.config.js`.

### API 🌎✨

![Logos for Related Projects](.github/API.png)

#### Working on this Project

Docker 🐳🐋

```bash
cd api
docker-compose up --build -d
```

or run the server locally 👨‍💻

```bash
yarn workspace api dev
```

This project depends on MongoDB 🍍 so if you're not using Docker 🐳🐋 locally, you should see this [gist](https://gist.github.com/nrollr/9f523ae17ecdbb50311980503409aeb3) on how to setup MongoDB on your machine.

#### Info 📝

Using hapi allows you to organize your endpoints very easiy and all the controllers are async so making database queries are fast and clean. All the routes are kept in `./api/src/routes.ts`. 🛣

This service handles authentication with JWT and basic CRUD functions. 🔐

You can see the documented endpoints at `http://localhost:3000/docs`

### Integration Testing 🌈🦁🐛

![Logos for Related Projects](.github/Integration.png)

#### Working on the Project

```bash
yarn workspace integration test
```

#### Info 📝

Short hand: `page` is just a representation of whatever the headless browser, _Puppeteer_ has rendered at that given moment.

Using Puppeteer I write assertions like this:

```js
describe("Feature", () => {
  it("does this thing", async () => {
    await page.waitForSelector("#selector");
    await page.click("#selector");
    await page.waitForSelector("#other-selector");
  });
});
```

This approach accomplishes two things:

- Ensures if an `await` statement errors or `catch()` the block will cause a failure
- Makes the test sequential and simpler to write

### Workflow 👷‍♀️🚧

![Logos for Related Projects](.github/Workflow.png)

Working on this project uses Travis to run the tests and deploy the successfully built workspaces to their given endpoints. It uses [`now`](https://zeit.co/now) for deployments for easy rollback and immutable deployments.
