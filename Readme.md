## About ü§îü¶Ñüéâ

> _A place to write._ ‚úçÔ∏è

So the idea here was simple build a simple markdown writing application. Markdown is a huge deal and all the cool tools kept getting shut down and naively,I thought, _how hard can this really be_? ü§îüìùüì¶

So I've had poorly designed iterations of this thing for every year, on the year as one of these services got shut down. When [Canvas](https://blog.usecanvas.com/) shut down this last year, I started to get a little more serious about this idea. üí° ‚ö°üî≠

During planning out some of my quarterly goals at my last job I decided to go a little more full-stack with Node and start to really work through the process of building a microservice. Since I'm never really one to learning languages and frameworks in the abstract, I decided to take up Downwrite as an excuse to build those microservices. üì°üí∏üåé

### Why Markdown üßêü§®üìã

Markdown is probably the most efficient and universal tool for conveying syntax, semantics and structure across platforms. ‚¨áÔ∏è

Originally coined by [John Gruber (Daring Fireball)](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) it was originally conceived as a text to HTML and is the staple of static site generators, OSS as well as a fair amount of comment sections, notetaking applications or any documentation tool. üõ†

These shortcuts are almost as ubiquitous as `cmd + b` for bold or `cmd + i` for italics. ‚å®Ô∏è

> Bottomline: markdown is data. It is a method for describing semantics of data and is data itself.

## Features ‚ú®üî•üöÄ

This is meant to be a simple writing application with some key features:

- Write wherever you are in markdown
- Share what you've written if you want
- Upload a markdown file from your machine
- Export to a static markdown file for your blog, etc.

## Setup üì≤‚è≥‚öôÔ∏è

This project uses Node (v12.18.x), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and Yarn.

```bash
brew cask install yarn
yarn
```

Personally use [`fnm`](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) to manage my node versions.

```bash
fnm install
fnm use
```

### Environment

To get started create an `.env` file in the root of your project with the following

```env
SECRET_KEY="SECRET SECRETS ARE NO FUN"
CURRENT_DB_ADDRESS="127.0.0.1:27017/downwrite"
```

### Client ‚ö°Ô∏èü¶ä

![Logos for Related Projects](.github/images/Client-2020.png)

#### Setup

Run in your terminal from the root of the project.

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser.

#### UI üìù

This is the client-side of the application, it uses Next.js and is a pretty stock implementation of how Next handles routing to different views. üë®‚Äçüíªü§úü¶ëü§Ø

Downwrite needs to server side rendered to make sharing an entry as easy as possible. Next.js' data-fetching API makes it the perfect candidate. So when the page calls `getServerSideProps()` it fetches the data directly from the database (DB creditentials aren't exposed to the client build at all because of the bundling features inside Next üòÅ) and for the initial render it has data available instead of a skeleton screen. ü§ñ‚ò†Ô∏èüíÄ

For the Editor this project uses Draft.js and Draft.js Plugins. Markdown syntax is used inline and autogenerates the related rich text `_hello_` becomes "_hello_" as you type.üíª‚å®Ô∏èüîè

For styles I just used the built-in CSS support in Next.js

#### Serverless Functions üåé‚ú®

To update the data, this project calls endpoints at `/api/....` to enable this we're using Next'js [API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction). These are serverless functions so we don't need to keep a server or database connectioin running all the time, with serverless functions you're essentially calling the API on-demand.

This project also depends on MongoDB üçç for data persistence, you should see this [gist](https://gist.github.com/nrollr/9f523ae17ecdbb50311980503409aeb3) on how to setup MongoDB on your machine.

To authenticate we're using JWT to call the basic CRUD functions. Basically this is using a stateless auth model, more about that [here](https://auth0.com/blog/stateless-auth-for-stateful-minds/). üîê

### Integration Testing üåàü¶Åüêõ

![Logos for Related Projects](.github/images/Integration.png)

```bash
yarn test
```

#### Info üìùüß™

Short hand: `page` is just a representation of whatever the headless browser, _Puppeteer_ has rendered at that given moment.

Using Puppeteer I write assertions like this:

```js
describe("Feature", () => {
  it("does this thing", async () => {
    await page.waitForSelector("#selector");
    await page.click("#selector");
    await page.waitForSelector("#other-selector");
  });
});
```

This approach accomplishes two things:

- Ensures if an `await` statement errors or `catch()` the block will cause a failure
- Makes the test sequential and simpler to write

### Workflow üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüöß

Working on this project it uses GitHub actions to run the tests and deploys using [`vercel`](https://vercel.com) for easy rollback and immutable deployments.
