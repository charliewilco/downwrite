## About

> _A place to write._ ✍️

So the idea here was simple build a simple markdown writing application. Markdown is a huge deal and all the cool tools kept getting shut down and naively,I thought, _how hard can this really be_? 🤔

So I've had poorly designed iterations of this thing for every year, on the year as one of these services got shut down. When [Canvas](https://blog.usecanvas.com/) shut down this last year, I started to get a little more serious about this idea. 💡 ⚡

During planning out some of my quarterly goals at my last job I decided to go a little more full-stack with Node and start to really work through the process of building a microservice. Since I'm never really one to learning languages and frameworks in the abstract, I decided to take up Downwrite as an excuse to build those microservices.

### Why Markdown

Markdown is probably the most efficient and universal tool for conveying syntax, semantics and structure across platforms.

Originally coined by [John Gruber (Daring Fireball)](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) it was originally conceived as a text to HTML and is the staple of static site generators, OSS as well as a fair amount of comment sections, notetaking applications
or any documentation tool.

These shortcuts are almost as ubiquitous as `cmd + b` for bold or `cmd + i` for italics.

> Bottomline: markdown is data. It is a method for describing semantics of data and is data itself.
