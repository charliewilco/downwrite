        Writing should be easy. But as each tool, each static site builder comes and
        falls out of popularity or gets shut down,
        <strong>**markdown**</strong> remains the central and portbale format.

      <p className="mb-4">
        The goal of building Downwrite was to create a place to write and share
        content with that universal format; to be able to import and export in
        markdown, to write in markdown and share your work.
