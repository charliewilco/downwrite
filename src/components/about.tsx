        Markdown is a huge deal and all the cool tools kept getting shut down and
        naively, I thought, how hard can this really be? So I&#39;ve had poorly
        designed iterations of this thing for every year on the year as one of these
        services got shut down. When Canvas shut down this last year, I started to

        a little more full-stack with Node and start to really work through the

        learning languages and frameworks in the abstract, I decided to take up
        Downwrite as an excuse to build those microservice.
